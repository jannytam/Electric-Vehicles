# Electric-Vehicles
**Authors:** Janny Tam, Jacob Greenbow, Peter Baran

**Date:** Winter 2021

**Language:** R

In this project we will be covering three main questions:

1. At what point will it be beneficial for consumters to switch to electric, while the energy produced to fuel these vehicles is still not "clean"? 
2. How costly is it to purchase a brand new vehicle? Can we predict the price of an electric vehicle using information such as car body, type of drive, etc?
3. Can we find the main aspets of a vehicle that contribute to the efficiency and how efficiency and range differ in colder climates as opposed to warmer temperatures?


#### Procedure:
- Web Scraping, PDF Scraping
- Variable Selection
- Assumption Testing
- Interpreting Coefficients
- Predicting price and range
